	<h1>Reflections</h1>

	<p>
	Prior to taking this course, my HTML and web design experience was limited to one high school project in which I wrote a truly <em>awful</em> HTML 1.0 webpage. That was 20 years ago.
	Until taking <em>CIS241</em>, I hadn't given much thought to how the web has changed in the past two decades. I now have to laugh as I look back at that botched attempt at webpage design. 
	It was a mish-mash of bright neon colors and discordant fonts at a time when much of the web was littered with just that sort of design.
	</p>
	<p>
	I've actually had several "Ah ha!" moments throughout this course. Here are a few.
	</p>
	<p>
	I always wondered why the text in some websites seems to overlap when I zoom in with the browser while it doesn't on other websites.
	Now that I know text size can be set by pixels or by proportion this behaviour makes much more sense.
	</p>
	<p>
	My old computer was constantly bombarded with notifications about Flash updates. Since I haven't seen a single notification on my newer computers I figured Adobe just wasn't updating Flash as frequently.
	I had another "Ah ha" moment when I learned that Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight are being phased out. For someone who hates to constantly perform updates, this was welcome news.
	</p>

	<h2>Thoughts on the Course</h2>
	<p>
	This class was the most challenging course for me this semester. Perhaps becuase there was a lot of new information for me to process. 
	I thought the materials (both the CIW materials and the instructor-provided supplements) were great. The supplemental videos provided by the instructor were especially helpful. 
	I also like the fact that several tools were introduced in this course (KompoZer, Filezilla, Notepad++). Between these and the labs I learned a lot this semester.
	The majority of the labs were very structured, which allowed me to focus on the topic at hand. 
	However, because the labs were so structured, the big picture didn't really fall into place until I dove into this final project.
	This project allowed me to put everything I learned together and helped me realize how much I actually learned this semester (and how much I still don't know)!
